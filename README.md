This repository contains the work for the following projects:

Dissertation  
My work on hydrogen bond geometries using Protein Data Bank data.  
Python script parses and calculates hydrogen bond distances; the R script was then used for statistical analysis of produced data

Sort range hydro bonds.py  
↳ Parses and calculates hydrogen bond distances from Protein Data Bank files

Diss R analysis.R  
↳ Loads hydrogen bond data and performs statistical analysis and visualization for dissertation

Data Mining Assignment  
Clustering algorithms implemented from scratch in Python  
Scored 100% in the coding section of the assignment

KMeans.py  
↳ Basic implementation of the standard KMeans clustering algorithm

KMeansplusplus.py  
↳ Improved initialization using KMeans++ for better clustering performance

BisectingKMeans.py  
↳ Hierarchical variant of KMeans that splits clusters recursively

KMeansSynthetic.py  
↳ Synthetic data generation and testing for clustering algorithms

Summer Industrial Project  
Compared a Recurrent Neural Network model to the Lee-Carter model using real Ghanaian insurance data.

RNN V2.2.R  
↳ Trains RNN model, and produces RNN forecasts to then compare to Lee-Carter
